KiwiCursor is a heavily customizable mouse that also has a ton of useful features, it also contains features not added to the current mouse such as better billboard support, better dragging, 3D gui functions, and more.

# 🖥️ Mouse:

The mouse can be customized however you like by layering multiple images, creating unlimited custom mouses, or changing the layers with the following options:
- Unlimited Icons
- Icon Priority (Set the render priority of mouse icons)
- Icon Layers (Stack images to create a single mouse)
- Rotation, Position, Size, Color, Image
- Display Order (Set GUI to display over the mouse)
